= Webview-zoom-demo

A simple hybrid demo app for zoom testing. 

Camera is opened by javascript with https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia[getUserMedia()] and zoom is applied by two methods :

- A native zoom (realwear intent)
- A front end zoom (MediaDevices API)

These methods won't work on any device. It depends if you are using a realwear device and if your webview is old enough to zoom via MediaDevices.
